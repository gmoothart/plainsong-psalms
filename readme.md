Plainsong Psalms
================

Purpose
-------
This repository is a collection of plainsong chant lines for the psalms as sung in the Anglicah church. Engraving is done in lilypond. Chant lines taken from [The Plainsong Psalter](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0898691621)


ToDo
----
- Chant bars on odd staff positions do not look good because of the underlying rest glyphs they use.
- line indents for psalm text
- extract formatting into a common file for re-use
- umlaut/tick discrepancy: ticks must go after the letter they appear over, but umlauts must go before.

Examples
-------
The examples directory, mostly for my own reference, contains samples taken with gratitude from http://forum.musicasacra.com/forum/discussion/7069/chant-in-lilypond/p1
